Photodegradation of methylene blue with TiO2 impregnated with Au via plasma
===========================================================================

Dataset by Debra Jene Kirkconnell Reyes measured at CINVESTAV-Merida.

## Normalization

First we normalize all the data. To do this we subtract from each dataset the minimum in the range 800-1000nm and then multiply for the maximum in that same range. This is done in the file ``normalize.R''.
